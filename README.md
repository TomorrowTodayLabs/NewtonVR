## Summary

**Now available on the Unity Asset store: [https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/75712](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/75712)**

**Go to [newtonvr.readme.io](http://newtonvr.readme.io) for documentation, guides on how to get started with NewtonVR, and basic integration instructions.**

**Our feature roadmap is public and can be found on Trello here: [https://trello.com/b/iLvugNpK/newtonvr](https://trello.com/b/iLvugNpK/newtonvr)**

Our system allows players to pick up, drop, throw, and use held objects. Items don't pass through other items (rigidbodies), or the environment (non-rigidbodies). Rather, held items interact with other rigidbodies naturally -- taking mass into account. For example, if you have two boxes of the same mass they can push each other equally, but a balloon, with considerably less mass, can't push a box.

*For more information on this style of mass-based interaction, [see this article by Nick Abel](http://www.vrinflux.com/newton-vr-physics-based-interaction-on-the-vive/), one of the creators of NewtonVR.*

Items can be configured to be picked up at any point, or when grabbed, can rotate and position themselves to match a predefined orientation. This lets you pick up a box from its corner as well as pick up a gun and have it orient to the grip.

We've also created a few physical UI elements to help with basic configuration and "menu type scenarios. We also give you the option to dynamically let the controllers turn into physical objects on a button press.
